        <h1 style="color: whitesmoke;">Background</h1>
        <p>Throughout the world, many groups of people continue to struggle to access basic needs like food, sanitation,
            housing, education, and health care. We understand these inequities as influenced by social, cultural,
            linguistic, economic, historical and political factors which create a context for marginalisation. We need
            to ask ourselves as speech-language therapists and audiologists: How are we contributing to addressing
            social inequalities that impact and affect communication? </p>
        <p>Within the professions of SLT/A, the majority of professionals work using a personal, one-to-one model of
            care. The challenge with such a model is the limited number of SLT/As to meet the need. We need to question:
            are our individualised models of care the best way to provide communication supports in the context of
            inadequate numbers of service providers? Are there other ways in which we could work? </p>
        <p>“EPIC provides a framework to rethink and transform clinical practices especially (but not only) for
            underserved populations…underpinned by critical science and decolonial theoretical influences” – Pillay &
            Kathard (2019).</p>
        <p>EPIC places emphasis on population-based health care services as an expansion of the current dominant
            personal, individualised practices. EPIC practice seeks to create an awareness of the alternative approaches
            to our work as SLT/A/s to the health care models that continues to dominate how we deliver services
            throughout the world.</p>

            <p style="color: rgb(4, 83, 83); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
                EPIC emerged through the realisation that current services are inequitable, inaccessible, and
                unaffordable
                for the majority of the South African population – impacting many poor, Black, African language speaking
                individuals. There was/is a need to expand our practices in ways that are responsive to the needs of our
                context. Beyond solely focusing on communication disability, we also need to think about how we
                contribute
                to address the inequities in our society. In other words, we need to consider how systemic injustices,
                (i.e.
                the lack of education, housing, resources, and health care) affect the opportunities available to
                children
                to succeed and its resultant impact on communication development. In 2018, Mershen and Harsha published
                their conceptual paper called “Renewing our cultural borderlands: Equitable, Population-Based
                Innovations
                for Communication (EPIC)” which documents the thinking around EPIC and the possibilities for shifting
                practices.
